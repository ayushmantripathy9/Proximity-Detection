# Proximity Detection using BLE via ESP32

## Introduction
IoT devices have grown numerously over the past few years. The data generated by these can have a huge impact in all domains. BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is of dire importance to these devices as using BLE, the sensory IoT devices can transmit a small amount of data at lower speeds. 

The main aim of our project is to perform Proximity Detection using the BLE via ESP32, where any device of interest would be detected if it falls within a specified range of the ESP32 module by making use of the BLE of the smart device. Other than this, many more functionalities like **Data Analysis**, **Multi-Device Detection**, **Synchronous Detection of a device using Multiple ESP32 modules**, and more have been offered. We have developed a full stack application having a *ReactJS frontend*, *NodeJS backend* and a *MySQL database* for the same.

## Features
* **Proximity Detection of Smart Devices** within the threshold range of ESP32 module using BLE
    - The presence of the device is shown if the RSSI is greater than a threshold value
* Displaying the **device status** (presence/absence) both in Ubidots and our Application
    - Using different colors of an **LED** to show the sending of data to **Ubidots and Backend**
    - **All the devices in range are shown** in the frontend in the *Device Status* page
* **Multi-Device Monitoring** has been supported
    - Devices can be monitored by using their BLE MAC Address or their Device Name
    - The detection via Device Name was added because most devices randomize their BLE MAC Addresses
    - **User can add new devices under monitoring directly from the frontend** by simply adding the name/ble-mac-address
    - **All the devices being monitored are displayed** in the frontend in the *Monitored Devices* page
* **Data Analysis** of the collected data and displaying it with indicators
    - All the collected data is stored in the database in a novel manner according to time-slots
    - The *percentage presence of the device in a time-slot* is calculated and displayed
    - **Presence indicators** are used during presenting the data to the user
        - green: device was detected for more than 75%
        - yellow: device was detected between 25% to 75%
        - red: device was detected for less than 25%
    - Data is shown for each day, averaged over weeks in each time-slot
* Support for **Multiple ESP32 devices** in a synchronous manner
    - Muliple ESP32 devices can act synchronously to detect the device
    - The *synchronization* between these is done using the *common backend*
    - Correct updation of device presence even if only one ESP32 module detects the device both in Ubidots and Frontend
    - Functionality to support an **Interval for Retained Presence** (15 seconds for now) 
* **Full Stack Application** made to support all the functionalities
    - *ReactJS* for developing the Frontend
    - *NodeJS* for developing the Backend
    - *MySQL Database* for storing the data
